This week TidyTuesday was using a new package called tidytext. It is a package to help in text mining dataset and books. I used with package to see how amount words the character Kelly said in every season. The tidytext package was great in The Office dataset. I have only scatched the surface of the tidytext package I would love to practice more in the future for other tidytuesday.
